# Product Manager

## Description
This project is a full-stack application with a React frontend and a Node.js backend. The application allows users to perform CRUD operations on products.
## Why did I build this?
I built this project to practice building a full-stack application with React and Node.js, as well as to gain experience using MongoDB as a database. My goal was to create a simple application that would allow me to perform CRUD operations on products. Additionally, I wanted to enhance my skills in using React Router to create a seamless single-page application. To manage state in the application, I utilized React Hooks. I also aimed to improve my understanding of backend validations and practice using props to pass data between components and create reusable components.

## Software and Libraries Used
| Technology | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| MongoDB | Used for the database, ideal for this project because of how it stores data in JSON-like documents |
| React | Used for building the user interface, includes React Router for routing, React Hooks for state management, and React Helmet for managing changes to the document head |
| Node.js | Used for the backend, includes Express for server setup, Mongoose for modeling the data, Dotenv for environment variable management, CORS for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, and Nodemon for automatic server restarts |
