# Navbar Project

This project is a simple React application that uses Vite for building and development. It demonstrates the use of React Router for navigation and includes three views: Home, About, and Contact.

## Project Structure

- `src/App.jsx`: This is the main component of the application. It sets up the routes for the different views.
- `src/components/NavBar.jsx`: This component represents the navigation bar. It uses `NavLink` from `react-router-dom` to create navigation links.
- `src/views/`: This directory contains the different views for the application.
- `src/styles/NavBar.css`: This file contains the styles for the `NavBar` component.
